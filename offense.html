            <p class="reasoning">Alex Smith, though currently injured, is the greatest
            quarterback I have ever seen. Ever been made fun of? Told you were
              incapable? Told you couldn't ever do somthing? Be replaced by someone
              better? Have you ever had to be the scapegoat for everyone else's failures?
               Alex Smith has done all of this. He was the face of San Francisco despite
               being in a toxic and dysfunctional work environment. And he persevered more
               than any other NFL quarterback ever would.</p>
